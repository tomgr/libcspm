-- svaref.csp

-- Bill Roscoe, July 2009 amended October 2010

-- A front-end to svacomp.csp that allows refinement testing between
-- the behaviours of partial systems.

-- When you may wish to perform refinement checks between shared variable
-- programs you should include this program, which in turn includes the
-- main compiler:

include "svacomp.csp"

-- At the time of writing SVA always uses the present file, since it
-- does not remove any functionality.

-- Refinement is more involved than testing whole threads, because we have to
-- take into account both the inter- and intra- thread ways our target
-- code interacts with others.  The logic behind what this file does is
-- explained in Chapter 19 of Understanding Concurrent Systems.

-- This program expects to support checks of the form

-- assert SeqRefTest(P) [T= SeqRefTest(P)
-- assert OTRefTest(P) [T= OTRefTest(P)
-- assert GenRefTest(P) [T= GenRefTest(P)

-- respectively representing refinement checking of a partial
-- system in sequential, parallel and general contexts.

-- Because of the syntactic structure of SVL programs, the first
-- and last of these expect P to be Cmd, while the middle one (in order
-- to allow P to contain parallelism) has P an SCStruct.


-- ParReads: includes all locations written by this code segment that
-- can be read by another thread.  Should be {} for sequential contexts.

-- ParWrites: includes all locations read by this Cmd that can be written
-- by another thread.  Should be {} for sequential contexts.

-- SeqReads: includes all locations read by this Cmd that might, at the
-- start of its execution, have been written to some value other than the
-- standard initialisation. Should be {} for parallel contexts.

-- SeqWrites: includes all locations written by the Cmd that might
-- be read by some piece of code that runs sequentially after our Cmd.
-- Should be {} for parallel contexts.

-- ext_atomic: Boolean which is true if other parallel threads might
-- go into an atomic section in the middle of the code we are testing.

-- These are all the ways in which our program can be influenced by or
-- influence the execution


-- We model external reads and writes much as before, but need to be able
-- to see the initial state our Cmd P runs from in the trace, and to be able to
-- see any relevant final values of locations in the trace also.

-- We therefore divide time into three periods: an initial one that established
-- the initialisation, the main one in which P runs, and a final one in
-- which the final values of locations in SeqWrites become apparent.

-- This is done by running a modified version of P in which the three
-- phases are divided by signals, where the external channel -1 is used
-- for reading and writing all the locations in all the four sets above,
-- and where which of these actions can happen when is governed by parallel
-- composition with a regulator process

-- access locations in the model, or to force it to suspend activity
-- while the external system goes atomic.
