{- A compiler for shared variable programs for use as part
of SVA1.0.

Bill Roscoe, July 2009, amended Oct 2010

This is an updated version of the share2.csp program developed
by Bill Roscoe and David Hopkins.  It has extended functionality
including the use of compression capabilities of FDR automatically, proper
arrays (i.e. with non-constant indices) and explicit subtyping possibilities
for integer variables.  It is important to note that the program format expected
by this script is NOT consistent with share2.csp: hence the change of name.

Documentation of this file is provided by Chapters 18 and 19 of my 
book, "Understanding Concurrent Systems".  

There is a companion file, "svaref.csp", which supports the refinement model
described in the second of these chapters.

This file is intended to be used as an include file in a CSP script describing
the program to be analysed, itself most likely generated by the SVA tool.

The GUI of SVA is designed to generate files that, by including this one,
simulate shared variable programs.  The GUI, by running FDR in batch mode on
the such files, tests assertions within the input programs and, by processing
any counter-example generated by FDR, displays a representation of the
counter example partitioned by thread.

There are several major implementation differences with previous versions:

1. There are no longer separate processes for evaluating expressions: expression   evaluation is now done by the thread processes.  Thus we now have a process
   for each parallel thread and (with one strange exception) one for each
   variable or array component, plus possibly a process to maintain atomicity.
2. There is at present no option for all expressions to be evaluated atomically,   since this is not a very natural thing to have alongside our compression 
   strategy. 
3. All reads and writes by threads are now labelled with the index of the
   thread.  Furthermore signals must now be separate between threads.  This is
   to achieve a natural alphabetised parallel composition to aid compression.
4. Each variable and array component is now associated with a particular thread.
   The programmer may optionally assign some by hand.  If a variable
   is not assigned in this way, it is automatically assigned to the first
   process in numerical order that can apparently write to it. If there is   
   a "variable" or array component that is never written, separate read-only
   (one state) copies are associated with every thread that can read it.  
   The interactions of each thread with its local variables are then hidden.
5  We allow two different ways of compiling systems:
   (i)  The standard one (Compile) is applied to a list of processes
   (ii) There is also StructuredCompile, which can be used where a system
        is formed from groups of processes that it makes sense to compress
        on the way to creating the overall system.  A special data type is
        provided for this.
6. We provide both basic compilation functions and ones that apply some
   compression strategies.  The basic compression strategy is to individually
   compress the combination of each process with its local variables.  We
   also allow hierarchical compression based on the structured form described
   above.
7. The main role in achieving atomicity is delegated to the variables, which
   prevent any thread other than the one who has the atomic "token" reading or
   writing.
8. Monitors are renamed as "Overseers".
   The variables that an overseer observes are automatically calculated to be
   ALL its shared variables.  You can have  many overseers provided
   that they do not share variables with each other.
9. This file supports refsva.csp by enabling the values of variables to
   be read from and written to by an external ``thread'', index -1. Similarly,
   thread -1 may demand an atomic section.
10 We support Dirty locations, namely ones for which a write takes a
   definite time, during which any other access of this location causes
   misbehaviour.

{- Here:

IW is a function of thread index returning the writable integer variables
   (including array components) for the given thread
IR is a function of thread index returning the readable integer variables
BW is a function of thread index returning the writable boolean variables
BR is a function of thread index returning the readable boolean variables

LIV and LBV return the variables that are assigned as local to the thread
   apart from
ROI and ROB which are the never-written (necessarily by anyone) local variables.
Variables are assigned to processes with the following priorities:
1. All variables of a monitor are assigned to it [so that it can definitely see
   all writes to such variables.
2. All variables that the user has requested to be associated to a thread.
3. All variables that this thread can write to but not prior one can
4. All other variables that this thread can read from.

Alpha and Alpha_at return the alphabets of the combinations of thread and local
   variables respectively where atomicity is not/is part of the simulation.

LI is a function indicating what events can be hidden after combining a process
   with its local variables

ua returns the nesting depth of Atomic commands (always 0 or 1 after One_At)

SEv returns the signal events of each component: these must be disjoint sets.

--------------------------

The following function computes the readable and writable variables of an
individual thread together with its atomicity depth and signal events.

-- Part 7.  Overseers

-- An overseer process synchronises on all reads and writes of the variables it
-- uses.  When it is inactive it will allow anybody to read or write such a
-- variable.  A read has no effect on it, but a write causes it to become active.
-- Once it has completed its activities it becomes active.

-- An overseer process is always given all its variables as local.  
-- This means that the
-- alphabet it is given will include all accesses of these variables.
-- The code that runs for an overseer in the absence of atomicity is as follows:

OvSrRun(P,k,IVs,BVs,pnumsl) = let 
              S = diff(pnumsl,{k})
              Inactive = iveval?j:S?v:IVs?_ -> Inactive
                         [] bveval?j:S?v:BVs?_ -> Inactive

              within
                Inactive

-- Here, IVs and BVs are the integer and boolean variables used by the overseer process P,
-- and k is the index of this process.

-- With atomicity, we have something to decide: does an atomic section have priority
-- over the overseer, or vice-versa.  There are arguments both ways, but we settle for
-- the former.  Therefore we should now have the overseer triggered by either one of
-- its variables being written outside an atomic section, or the ending of an atomic
-- section which included such a write.

OvSrRun_at(P,k,IVs,BVs,pnumsl) =
