-- This DRAFT file supports various semi-automated compression techniques over
-- CSP networks for use with FDR.  

-- It it is designed to accompany the author's forthcoming book
-- "Understanding Concurrency"
-- and is an updated version of the 1997 file "compresion.csp" that
-- accompanied "Theory and Practice of Concurrency".

-- We assume that networks are presented to us as 
-- structures comprising process/alphabet pairs arranged in list
-- arrangements,

-- or (09) as members of the structured datatype

datatype PStruct = PSLeaf.(Proc,Set(Events)) | PSNode.Seq(PStruct)

-- This can only be used with FDR 2.91 and up where processes (Proc) are allowed
-- as parts of user-defined types.

-- We may (subject to alterations to FDR) be able to support more complex
-- structured types over processes.

-- The alphabet of any such list is the union of the alphabets of
-- the component processes:

alphabet(ps) = Union(set(<A | (P,A) <- ps>))

-- The vocabulary of a list is the set of events that are synchronised
-- between at least two members:

vocabulary(ps) = if #ps<2 then {} else
                 let A = snd(head(ps))
		     V = vocabulary(tail(ps))
		     A' = alphabet(tail(ps))
		 within
		     union(V,inter(A,A'))

-- The following is a function 
-- that composes a process/alphabet list without any
-- compression:

ListPar(ps) = let N=#ps within
              || i:{0..N-1} @ [snd(cnth(i,ps))] fst(cnth(i,ps))

-- The most elementary transformation we can do on a network is to
-- hide all events in individual processes that are neither relevant to
-- the specification nor are required for higher synchronisation.
-- The following function takes as its (curried) arguments a compression
-- function to apply at the leaves, a process/alphabet list to compose
-- in parallel and a set of events which it is desired to hide (either
-- because they are genuinely internal events or irrelevant to the spec).
-- It hides as much as it can in the processes, but does not combine them

CompressLeaves(compress)(ps)(X) = let V = vocabulary(ps) 
                                    N = #ps
				    H = diff(X,V)
				within
		  <(compress(P\inter(A,H)),diff(A,H)) | (P,A) <- ps>

-- The following uses this to produce a combined process

LeafCompress(compress)(ps)(X) = ListPar(CompressLeaves(compress)(ps)(X))\X

-- It is often advantageous to be able to apply lazy or mixed abstraction
-- operators in the same sort of way as the above does for hiding.  The
-- following are two functions that generalize the above: they take a
-- pair of event-sets (X,S): X is the set we want to abstract and S is
-- the set of signal events (which need not be a subset of X).  The
-- result is that inter(X,S) is hidden and diff(X,S) is lazily
-- abstracted.   Note that you can get the effect of pure hiding (eager
-- abstraction by setting S=Events) and pure lazy abstraction by setting
-- S={}.  Note also, however, that if you are trying to lazily abstract
-- a network with some natural hiding in it, that all these hidden events
-- should be treated as signals.

LeafMixedAbs(compress)(ps)(X,S) = 
                           let V = vocabulary(ps) 
                               N = #ps
                               D = diff(X,S)
                               H'= diff(X,V)

		  <(compress((P[|inter(A,D)|] 
		    compress(CHAOS(inter(A,D))))\inter(A,H')),diff(A,H')) 
				 | (P,A) <- ps>

-- The substantive function is then:

MixedAbsLeafCompress(compress)(ps)(X,S) = 
       ListPar(LeafMixedAbs(compress)(ps)(X,S))\X


-- The next transformation builds up a list network in the order defined
-- in the (reverse of) the list, applying a specified compression function
-- to each partially constructed unit.

-- combine them all without trying to compress any further.

-- The following are some functional programming constructs used above
